# Shale
Shale is an obsidian-style markdown editor with extra developer focused features. Shale is built with GPUI in Rust

## Goals
- [ ] "Live preview" (obsidian-style) Markdown editor with vim binding support
- [ ] File tree and interface
- [ ] Wiki-links
- [ ] MCP server
- [ ] Spellcheck and grammar checking using HarperLS. Support for custom language servers.
- [ ] Near-perfect compatibility with Obsidian vaults 
- [ ] Image support in vaults
- [ ] Theming support and support for custom themes. Include light and dark themes.
- [ ] Graph view

- Config files in TOML
- Assure any code you reference or copy from online has a commercial permissible licensing 
- Write unit tests 
- Regularly commit to a local git repo. You don't need to publish it. Don't override the user's global config, make a local override for a user for yourself.
- Expand this plan and goals as needed.
- Assure **proper** support for manipulating tables with vim bindings. No unexpected around when manipulating tables. 
- Tree-sitter powered code highlighting for code blocks.
- Full keyboard support if at all possible. 98% of the app should not require mouse usage. Mouse in the settings menu is fine.
- Indexing for quick wiki-link look up and resolving.

## Non-Goals
- Plugins

### Tech Stack
Keep as much in Rust as possible, no bindings external libraries. Update the tech stack as needed.
- Tokio for async
- GPUI for UI — **from Zed's repo, tag `v1.25.3`** (`gpui` + `gpui_platform`
  with `wayland`/`x11`/`font-kit`). crates.io `gpui` 0.2.2 is an older tree whose
  Wayland backend stalls its frame/present loop, so the window never updates on
  compositors like niri; the `gpui_linux` crate at this tag has the rewritten
  frame-loop state machine and works. Apache-2.0 (commercially fine).
  On Linux the renderer is wgpu (Vulkan), so a Vulkan driver is required.
- Serde for file parsing
- You may want to use GPUI kit, a components library for GPUI. Evaluate if it's useful before using.

  Note (evaluated): gpui-kit's crates (`gpui-pre`, `gpui-base`) are a **fork of
  gpui**, so they cannot be mixed with Zed's gpui — a component library would
  have to be built on our own elements. Don't re-litigate this without checking
  the dependency tree.

### MCP
Shale has an MCP server with support for reading, writing, and searching vaults. The MCP server should *either* be a separate binary which shares core functionality with a `common` crate in the project, or if speed will be acceptable use the main binary.

### Graph View
The graph view needs to have filter options to hide and show nodes. It should have the option to color nodes based on tags. I want the ability to sort into "constellations" based on the subfolder the note rests in. Add the option to filter a parent folder to then have the constellations be its children. Add 3d and 2d graph views. Graph should have the option to be static, where each note gets it's position from some sort of stable and fast method, and a dynamic physics based graph like Obsidian has. Make sure to handle duplicate note names and other weird edge cases. 

Example of constellations:
vault /
  child 1/
    pie/
    cake/
  child 2/
    child 2 1/
    child 2 2/
  note.md
  note2.md
When the constellation filter is set to child 1 it's children, `pie/` and `cake/` should be shown as separate filtered areas.

Also add the ability to have nested constellations shown. 

## Current status (updated as the project progresses)

Workspace layout:
- `crates/core` (`shale-core`): vault model (path-traversal safe), wiki-link
  extraction/resolution/backlinks, search, TOML config (`shale.toml` in the
  vault), text `Buffer` with undo/redo, and the vim mode engine. Pure Rust,
  fully unit tested.
- `crates/app` (`shale` binary): GPUI app (Zed's gpui, tag `v1.25.3`) — file
  tree sidebar, custom line-based editor view with vim normal/insert modes
  (hjkl, w/b/e, 0 ^ $, gg/G, dd, x, i/a/I/A/o/O, undo/redo, clipboard, mouse
  click to position), wiki-link styling (resolved tinted blue, unresolved dimmed)
  and navigation (`gx` on a link in normal mode, ctrl+click), status bar (mode,
  dirty flag, path, row:col), ctrl+s save.
- `crates/mcp` (`shale-mcp` binary): MCP stdio server exposing list/read/
  write/search/backlinks tools.

### GPUI gotchas (learned the hard way — re-read before touching the UI)
- **Never use crates.io `gpui` 0.2.2.** Its Wayland backend requests a
  `wl_surface` frame callback exactly once (at first configure) and then depends
  on the compositor's callback chain; under niri that chain stalls, so the app
  keeps drawing new frames (render logs prove it) but never presents them — the
  window looks frozen at its first frame and only updates when the compositor
  forces a full redraw (resize, remap). Zed's tag `v1.25.3` has the rewritten
  frame-loop state machine in `gpui_linux` and works. `gpui_platform` /
  `gpui_linux` are **not on crates.io**, so the git pin is load-bearing.
  Debug aid: `--open-after <secs>` opens a note after the window exists, which is
  the repro for that bug.
- **Views must register their input handler during paint.** Typed printable
  characters are not keymap actions; gpui hands them to whichever handler was
  registered with `window.handle_input(&focus, ElementInputHandler::new(bounds,
  entity), cx)` while painting the current frame. Forget it and every character
  is silently dropped while bound keys (enter/backspace/dd/x) keep working —
  exactly the symptom we hit. `LineElement::paint` does this once per frame
  (guarded by `MarkdownEditor::input_registered`, reset in `render`).
- Other API notes for this version: `gpui_platform::application()` instead of
  `Application::new()`; `ShapedLine::paint` takes `TextAlign` + `align_width`;
  `Window::focus` takes `cx`; `TextRun.len` and `ShapedLine::x_for_index` are
  **utf-8 byte** offsets, while the input-handler range methods are utf-16.

### Testing
- `crates/core`: pure-Rust unit tests (vault, markdown, search, buffer, vim).
- `crates/app`: headless UI tests via gpui's `test-support` feature
  (`#[gpui::test]` + `VisualTestContext::simulate_keystrokes/simulate_input`),
  which is how input-path regressions get caught without a live window.
- Manual Wayland checks: `grim` for full-screen, `niri msg action
  screenshot-window --id <id> --write-to-disk true` for a single window, and
  `niri msg --json windows` to find the window id.

System dependency (Linux): `libxkbcommon-x11-devel` (plus fontconfig, freetype,
x11, xcb, wayland dev packages) and a working Vulkan driver (the Linux renderer
is wgpu).

renderer is wgpu).

Next steps, roughly in order:
1. ~~Wiki-link rendering/highlighting + navigation~~ Done: resolved links tinted,
   unresolved dimmed; `gx` / ctrl+click follow the link under the cursor.
   Still TODO here: creating a note from an unresolved link, and link preview.
2. Live preview mode (rendered markdown toggle) — pulldown-cmark for parsing.
3. Visual mode, more vim operators (c/d + motions, counts), table-aware
   motions for the table-manipulation goal.
4. Theming (light/dark, TOML theme files).
5. HarperLS / LSP integration for spellcheck and grammar.
6. Image display in vaults (gpui image elements).
7. File tree: new/rename/delete, file watching.
